# 📘 Student Depression Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Description

This project  aims to use machine learning 🤖 for predicting depression 😔 in students. We utilize popular classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes to analyze student mental health data 📊. The data includes various features like age, gender, course of study, CGPA, marital status, and mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, panic attacks) to predict the likelihood of depression in students.

## 💻 Installation

To run this project, you need Python 🐍 and several libraries including pandas 🐼, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and seaborn.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HayaAbdullahM/Machine-Learning-Classification.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Machine-Learning-Classification

# Install required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```

## 🚀 Usage

The notebook `ProjectDMFinal.ipynb` contains the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Open it in a Jupyter environment to execute the code cells.

```bash
# Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

🔍 Navigate to `ProjectDMFinal.ipynb` in the Jupyter Notebook interface to view and run the code.

## 📊 Data

The dataset used (`Student Mental health.csv`) contains information on students' demographic details, academic performance, and mental health status. It includes features like gender, age, course of study, CGPA, marital status, and mental health conditions.
